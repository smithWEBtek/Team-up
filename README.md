# Team Up

Team Up allows you to keep track of the friends you play games with. You can
pair them to a certain team and view the players of that team and just that team.
You can create goals for a team and create different teams with different goals.

## Getting Started

In order to get this running on your local machine, just:
Git clone,
bundle install,
rake db:migrate,
rails s
After this go to localhost:3000 and you can view it on your machine


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rails and Ruby installed on your local computer to view the project live.
```
gem install rails
```

### Installing

Git Clone in your terminal and cd into the folder, then open up your favorite IDE.
Here you will find a rails directory, the majority of the code is located in the
Model, Controller, views, and the db folder.



```
```
Currently there are no test, but some will be coming soon.
```
